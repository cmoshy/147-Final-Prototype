# Gemetic Dungeon

**Gemetic Dungeon** is a procedural dungeon generation game currently in its pre-release, prototype phase. The game features basic dungeon generation and movement mechanics, allowing you to explore and navigate through randomly created dungeons.

## Current Features

- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: Each dungeon is uniquely generated, providing a different layout each time you play.
- **Player Movement**: Use the arrow keys to navigate through the dungeon.

## Placeholder Assets

- **Tileset**: The current tileset is a placeholder and not the final version. As a result, the tiles may not look polished or visually appealing.
- **Player Sprite**: Represented by a blue dot.

## Missing Features

- **Final Tileset**: The game currently uses a placeholder tileset. A final, polished tileset is in development.
- **Autotiling Logic**: The autotiling logic is still being implemented to enhance the visual coherence of the dungeon tiles.

## How to Play

1. **Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move your character (the blue dot) around the dungeon.
2. **Objective**: Find the tile that matches the one you spawned on. This tile serves as the exit and will trigger the generation of a new dungeon.
3. **Refresh**: If the tiles are hard to distinguish, manually refreshing the game can make it easier to locate the exit tile.

## Important Notes

- **Tile Visibility**: Occasionally, the tiles may render in a way that makes them difficult to distinguish. Refreshing the game may help improve visibility and make it easier to find the exit tile.

## Future Updates

We are actively working on completing the final tileset and implementing the autotiling logic to improve the visual and functional aspects of the game. Stay tuned for updates as we move towards a more polished and complete version of Gemetic Dungeon.
